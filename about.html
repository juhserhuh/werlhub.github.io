                <h1>About Werlhub</h1>
                <p>Yo, welcome to Werlhub! It's a place where you can upload and share your projects with the world, kind of like GitHub, but hopefully better. It's designed to make it super easy to host and manage code, work on open-source projects, and collaborate with others.</p>

                <h2>Why Did We Create Werlhub?</h2>
                <p>Well, we were tired of some of the stuff that other platforms like GitHub make complicated, so we decided to build our own space. We wanted something clean, easy to use, and fast. That's where Werlhub comes in. We also wanted to give you a simple way to use the 'werl' CLI tool to download repos straight from the terminal. Less hassle, more coding.</p>

                <h2>What Can You Do Here?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Host Your Code:</strong> Upload your projects and let others use, learn from, and contribute to your code. Simple.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> You can fork and pull requests, just like other platforms. It’s an open-source dream.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the CLI Tool:</strong> Download your favorite repos easily with the 'werl' command. You don’t even have to open a browser.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
                <p>Getting started is super easy. Just create an account, upload your repo, and boom—you’re in business. You can start sharing your code with the community right away. And with the 'werl' CLI tool, you can grab any repo with a simple command like <code>werl whirl {repo}</code>.</p>

                <h2>Who’s Behind Werlhub?</h2>
                <p>We’re just a group of people who like coding and wanted a better way to share our projects. We’re constantly working on making Werlhub better and adding more features, so stay tuned!</p>

                <h2>What’s Coming Next?</h2>
                <p>We’ve got a bunch of features planned for the future. We’re working on improving the user interface, adding more control over your repositories, and making the CLI tool even more powerful. If you’ve got any ideas or requests, let us know!</p>

                <h2>Support</h2>
